\section{Threat Model}
\label{sec:threat_model}

We describe adversarial capabilities and goals in detail in the threat model published on our website. % TODO: Add missing link.
To summarize, we consider an honest-but-curious server that has additional active network capabilities.
The server has therefore access to encrypted data, but cannot actively alter, delete or copy data.

We address most of the resulting threats directly in the platform's cryptographic design.
However, to defend against \ac{MITM}, and partly against impersonation attacks (server authentication) we rely on the security guarantees given by the \ac{TLS} protocol.
