title: Conclusion
---

We have presented the cryptographic design of CryptPad, a web-based, end-to-end
encrypted, collaborative real-time editor for a variety of documents.
We have shown realistic security threats for people with sensitive data and how
we address them.
We have explained how we use cryptography to enable various end-to-end encrypted
applications, such as documents, messaging and team communication.

Since its initial release 2015, CryptPad's user base has steadily grown.
This shows, that the cryptographic design choices are also well-received by the
platform's users.
All in all, CryptPad has proved to be a long-lasting, sustainable open source
project striving privacy-focused collaboration to the next level.
