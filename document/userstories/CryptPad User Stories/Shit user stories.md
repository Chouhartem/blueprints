## Shit user stories

> As a **registered user** I want to **access my drive** but I can't because **I
> forgot my password**.

Background:

* There is no way to reset the password as the server does neither now the
  password, nor the username, nor any other information (such as email).
* Social Secret Sharing can help

> As a **registered user** I want to **find a document I created last week** but
> I can't because **I did not add it to my drive**.

> As a **user with sensitive information in my drive** I want to **keep my data
> secure** but I can't because **I did not log out of CryptPad before police
> seized my laptop**.
