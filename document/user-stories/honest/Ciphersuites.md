> As a **high-risk user** I want to **use the most-secure cryptography for all
> my documents** so that **my old documents are not readable by modern
> adversaries with new capabilities**.

Background:

* There is currently no way to re-encrypt documents under new algorithms
* Since documents may contain long-term secrets, they should be protected even
  against new vulnerabilities

Acceptance:

* [ ] Shared URLs should still work
* [ ] User's are not bothered with crypto details
* [ ] There is one button to update _all_ documents
