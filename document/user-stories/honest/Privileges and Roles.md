#### Privileges and Roles

> As an **administrator of a hierarchically organized team** I want to **remove
> team members/viewers** so that **they have no more read and or write access to
> all team documents**.

Background:

* Problem: The keys are static, and will never be changed. A former team member
  can therefore still subscribe to a team's channel to receive and  decrypt
  updates about the team and its documents
* [Known
  Caveat](https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/security.html#access-of-former-team-members)
  in our docs
