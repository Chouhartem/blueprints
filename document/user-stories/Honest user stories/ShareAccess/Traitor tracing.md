#### Traitor tracing

> As an **activist** I want to **create
> individualized guest links** so that I can **trace who leaks access to
> sensitive content**.

Background:

* We cannot prevent users from sharing their access with other, third-party
  users. A user posting anonymously a shared link in social media can therefore
  leak the content of a sensible document and even give write access
* While traitor tracing cannot prevent this, it will increase the pressure on
  not to do that

Acceptance Criteria:

* [ ] Only a set of trusted users can do the traitor tracing
* [ ] Users must know that their link is traceable back to them
