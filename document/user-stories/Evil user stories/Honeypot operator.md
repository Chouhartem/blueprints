### Honeypot operator

> As an **intelligence agent** I want to **list my malicious server as a public
> instance on cryptpad.org** so that **I can compromise a particular demographic
> of users** (i.e., climate activists within France).

Background:

* We cannot technically stop malicious actors from running CryptPad instances.
* What helps, however, is to provide a verified client, so that no malicious
  code can be delivered, and e2ee is still guaranteed.
