\section{Introduction}

  During the writing of the cryptography white paper, we discovered multiple issues and limitations in the current version of CryptPad.
  While none of them are classified severe, requiring immediate action, or posing a serious threat for users, they nevertheless should be addressed.

  In this document, we list the problems, show their consequences, suggest how to fix them and outline possible drawbacks.
  We classified them into three different categories: short-term improvements (c.f. \cref{sec:shortterm}) that can be done immediately within the current version of CryptPad, mid-term improvements (c.f. \cref{sec:midterm}) that require the introduction of a new version of the encryption schemes, and long-term improvements (c.f. \cref{sec:longterm}) that can only be addressed with architectural changes.


\section{Short-Term Improvements} \label{sec:shortterm} % Can be done within current system
  In this section, we list improvements that can be done without requiring bigger changes of the underlying encryption schemes or architecture.

\section{Long-Term Improvements} \label{sec:longterm} % Require a new architecture
