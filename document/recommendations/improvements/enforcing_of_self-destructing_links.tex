\subsection{Enforcing of Self-Destructing Links}

\paragraph{Problem:}
The destroying of a document that was shared with a \textit{view-once-and-destroy} is not enforced by the server.

\paragraph{Consequences:}
A malicious user can open such a link, but decide to not destroy the document.
However, it is hard to come up with a scenario in which a malicious user could not achieve the same by simply taking a screenshot of the document.

\paragraph{Suggestions:}
Enforce the destruction on the server side.

\paragraph{Drawbacks:} Although the server sent the content, there is no guarantee that the user actually received it (e.g., due to connectivity problems or an active network attack).
Hence a document could get destroyed before being accessed the first time.\footnote{Currently, a destroyed document is only achieved, and could therefore be restored by instance admins).}
