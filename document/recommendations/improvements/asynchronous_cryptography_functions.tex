\subsection{Asynchronous Cryptography Functions}

\paragraph{Problem:}
The current cryptography functions including encryption and key derivation (such as \texttt{ViewCryptor2}) are synchronous and do block all resources.

\paragraph{Consequences:}
No operations can be done in parallel to cryptography functions.
Moreover, natively supported asynchronous functions (e.g., \texttt{SHA-256}) that would bring a speedup cannot be used.

\paragraph{Suggestions:}
Opt for a more general interface in which cryptography functions are asynchronous

\paragraph{Drawbacks:}
The additional workload coming from parallel execution may be too resource-intensive on some devices, such as smartphones.
Refactoring large parts of the code to make it asynchronous is tedious.
