\subsection{Instance salt is rarely set}

\paragraph{Problem:}
Instance administrators need to set a custom \texttt{loginSalt} before running CryptPad in a production environment.
This value is supposedly only rarely changed from the default.

\paragraph{Consequences:}
The \texttt{loginSalt} makes it such attackers who want to brute-force common credentials must do so again on each CryptPad instance that they wish to attack. If \texttt{loginSalt} is the default one, then there is no protection against this.

\paragraph{Suggestions:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Mention the \texttt{loginSalt} more prominently in the documentation.
  \item Write an installation script that initializes this salt to a random value.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Drawbacks:}
