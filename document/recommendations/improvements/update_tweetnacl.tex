\subsection{Update TweetNaCl}

\paragraph{Problem:} CryptPad uses TweetNaCl~\cite{Bernstein2015,Chestnykhm2016} version~0.12.2 (September 18, 2014) while the newest version is 1.0.3 (February 10, 2020).

\paragraph{Consequences:} CryptPad misses optimizations and security fixes introduced in later versions.
In the current version, \texttt{nacl.sign} or \texttt{nacl.sign.detached} could create incorrect signatures.
Moreover, CryptPad it might be hard to update TweetNaCl in case of a severe security issue.

\paragraph{Suggestions:} Update TweetNaCl to the latest version.

\paragraph{Drawbacks:}
TweetNaCl has refactored some of the utilities into a separate library and now properly validates the base64 padding before decoding.
An update therefore requires significant work.
