### Problem:

The four roles in a team are called *viewer*, *member*, *admin*, and
*owner*. The role *member* conflicts with the common notion of "being a
member of a team".

### Consequences:

Users are confused about the difference and precise wording in
documentations is difficult.

### Suggestions:

Replace *member* with *author*.

### Drawbacks:

The notion of an *author* may not smoothly match the context of creating
folders or drawing in a whiteboard.
