  abstract  = {Groupware systems are computer-based systems that support two or more users engaged in a common task, and that provide an interface to a shared environment. These systems frequently require fine-granularity sharing of data and fast response times. This paper distinguishes real-time groupware systems from other multi-user systems and discusses their concurrency control requirements. An algorithm for concurrency control in real-time groupware systems is then presented. The advantages of this algorithm are its simplicity of use and its responsiveness: users can operate directly on the data without obtaining locks. The algorithm must know some semantics of the operations. However the algorithm's overall structure is independent of the semantic information, allowing the algorithm to be adapted to many situations. An example application of the algorithm to group text editing is given, along with a sketch of its proof of correctness in this particular case. We note that the behavior desired in many of these systems is non-serializable.},

  abstract  = {Document editing has migrated in the last decade from a mostly individual activity to a shared activity among multiple persons. The World Wide Web and other communication means have contributed to this evolution. However, collaboration via the web has shown a tendency to centralize information, making it accessible to subsequent uses and abuses, such as surveillance, marketing, and data theft.Traditionally, access control policies have been enforced by a central authority, usually the server hosting the content, a single point of failure. We describe a novel scheme for collaborative editing in which clients enforce access control through the use of strong encryption. Encryption keys are distributed as the portion of a URI which is not shared with the server, enabling users to adopt a variety of document security workflows. This system separates access to the information ("the key") from the responsibility of hosting the content ("the carrier of the vault"), allowing privacy-conscious editors to enjoy a modern collaborative editing experience without relaxing their requirements.The paper presents CryptPad, an open-source reference implementation which features a variety of editors which employ the described access control methodology. We will detail approaches for implementing a variety of features required for user productivity in a manner that satisfies user-defined privacy concerns.},

Notwithstanding its apparent modernity, the majority of recent cryptosystems have not enjoyed widespread adoption.

  abstract  = {We introduce new theoretical measures for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of encryption schemes designed for broadcast transmissions. The goal is to allow a central broadcast site to broadcast secure transmissions to an arbitrary set of recipients while minimizing key management related transmissions. We present several schemes that allow a center to broadcast a secret to any subset of privileged users out of a universe of size n so that coalitions of k users not in the privileged set cannot learn the secret. The most interesting scheme requires every user to store O ( k log k log n ) keys and the center to broadcast O( k 2 log 2 k log n ) messages regardless of the size of the privileged set. This scheme is resilient to any coalition of k users. We also present a scheme that is resilient with probability p against a random subset of k users. This scheme requires every user to store O (log k log(l/p)) keys and the center to broadcast O ( k log 2 fclog(l/p)) messages.},

We discover that current systems for encrypting content to sets of users are subject to attacks on user privacy. We propose a new mechanism, private broadcast encryption, to protect the privacy of users of encrypted file systems and content delivery systems. We construct a private broadcast scheme, with a strong privacy guarantee against an active attacker, that achieves ciphertext length, encryption time, and decryption time comparable with the non-private schemes currently used in encrypted file systems.},

This yields the first candidate optimal broadcast encryption that is plausibly post-quantum secure, and enjoys a security reduction to a simple assumption. As a secondary contribution, we present a candidate ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme for circuits of a-priori bounded polynomial depth where the parameter size is independent of the circuit size, and prove security under an additional non-standard assumption.},

We show that it is feasible to construct anonymous tag-based hint systems from Ring-LWE problem for which we use a variant with "small" secrets known to be as hard as regular Ring-LWE. We employ an IND-CCA-secure public key encryption scheme from LWE [12] for the PKE component of the anonymous broadcast encryption scheme.},

  abstract  = {In 2012, NIST standardized SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256, two truncated variants of SHA-512, in FIPS 180-4. These two hash functions are faster than SHA-224 and SHA-256 on 64-bit platforms, while maintaining the same hash size and claimed security level. So far, no third-party analysis of SHA-512/224 or SHA-512/256 has been published. In this work, we examine the collision resistance of step-reduced versions of SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 by using differential cryptanalysis in combination with sophisticated search tools. We are able to generate practical examples of free-start collisions for 44-step SHA-512/224 and 43-step SHA-512/256. Thus, the truncation performed by these variants on their larger state allows us to attack several more rounds compared to the untruncated family members. In addition, we improve upon the best published collisions for 24-step SHA-512 and present practical collisions for 27 steps of SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256, and SHA-512.},
