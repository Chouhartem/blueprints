### Admin onboarding

> As an **instance administrator** I want to **generate individualized or
> multiple user invitation codes** so that **I can onboard my friends while
> keeping registration closed to the public**.

Background:

* See issue [close registration unless you have been invited into a
  team](https://forum.cryptpad.org/d/118-close-registration-unless-you-have-been-invited-into-a-team)
* Helps to prevent against spam/DoS registrations
