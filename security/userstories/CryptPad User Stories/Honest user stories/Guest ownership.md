### Guest ownership

> As an **unregistered user** I want to **delete documents that I created** so
> that I **can always redact my sensitive data**.

Background:

* Unregistered users have a public key in their _guest drive_. However, as soon
  as they lost access to this drive (e.g., they use a new device or emptied the
  cache), they loose the public key
* Currently, users have to write to the support, and "prove" that they are
  legitimated to delete the document.
* Encapsulating the deletion capability into the link lets other users also
  easily delete the document...
* One possible way is to standardize the support (i.e., which informations are
  needed for the support team to delete the document?)

Acceptance Criteria:

* [ ] Lower workload for support
* [ ] Making it understandable for users what they can/cannot do.
