#### File system sync

> As a **user with frequent network interruptions** I want to **synchronize my
> drive with my local file system** so that **I can continue my work offline when
> I cannot reach the CryptPad server**

Background:

* Offline-first editing partially answers this
* This could partially be achieved in the browser, i.e., with a progressive web
  app
