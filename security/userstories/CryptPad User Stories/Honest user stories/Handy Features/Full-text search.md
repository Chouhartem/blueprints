#### Full-text search

> As a **person with many documents and poor discipline when naming files** I
> want to **search the full text of all my documents for some keywords** so that
> **I can find files based on my vague memories**.

Background:

* Issue [Full text search in document content
  #870](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/issues/870)
* This requires decrypting all documents
