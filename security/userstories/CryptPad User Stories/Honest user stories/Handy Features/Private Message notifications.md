#### Private Message notifications

> As a **user of CryptPad's 1-1 chat system** I want to **receive a notification
> when I have the contacts app closed and there is a message that I haven't
> seen** so that **I don't have to open the app to see messages**.

Background:

* Issue [Notification when receiving private messages
  #764](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/issues/764)
* Possibly only UI?
