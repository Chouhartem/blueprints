> As a **user with a slow CPU and/or bad network connection** I want **CryptPad
> to prioritize maintaining a solid server connection over decrypting incoming
> messages** so that **I can synchronize my account state without my CPU locking
> up and repeatedly being disconnected when I first open CryptPad**.
