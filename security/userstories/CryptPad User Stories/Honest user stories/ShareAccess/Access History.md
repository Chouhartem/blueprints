#### Access History

> As a **document author** I want to **see the timestamps of access for
> different users** so that **I know who has which state of information**.

> As a **participator** I want to **hide the timestamps of my access** so that
> **my collaborators can not infer when and how long I worked.**.

Background:

* The stories are obviously conflicting, but both valid.

Acceptance criteria:

* [ ] Ideally, this is changeable on a per-instance basis, so that, e.g.,
  companies deploying CryptPad can prioritize accountability over anonymity
