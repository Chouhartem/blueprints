## Evil user stories

A template that's commonly used to improve security is called the "Evil User
Story" or "Abuse User Story" and is used as a way to think like a hacker in
order to consider scenarios that might occur in a cyber-attack. These stories
are written from the perspective of an attacker attempting to compromise or
damage the application, rather the typical personae found in a user story:
> As a **disgruntled employee**, I want to **wipe out the user database** to
> **hurt the company**
