\subsection{Limit Login Block Size}

\paragraph{Problem:}
There is no maximum login block size enforced by the server.

\paragraph{Consequences:}
Attackers can run a \ac{DoS} attack on the server's memory by uploading large data as login blocks.
The initial login block has to be signed which may impose too much computational work for the attack to be successful.
However, the initial login block can be replaced in which case only the corresponding public key has to be signed.

\paragraph{Suggestions:}
Impose a limit on the login block size.

\paragraph{Drawbacks:}
The username is part of the login block. Therefore the size is not bound theoretically, but only practically (e.g., username not bigger than 100 characters).\footnote{It is unclear, whether the username is needed to be in the login block at all. This has to be further investigated.}
Moreover, the login block size might grow in the future in which case the limit has potentially to be adapted.
