\subsection{Deduplicate Code}

\paragraph{Problem:}
The functions \href{https://github.com/xwiki-labs/chainpad-crypto/blob/c8b76b895f67719a3b799daac3d832fdfea45613/crypto.js#L191}{\texttt{createViewCryptor2}} and \href{https://github.com/xwiki-labs/chainpad-crypto/blob/c8b76b895f67719a3b799daac3d832fdfea45613/crypto.js#L276}{\texttt{createFileCryptor2}} essentially provide the same functionality:
provide a read-only access to a document.

\paragraph{Consequences:}
It is harder to understand and maintain what the two functions do.

\paragraph{Suggestions:}
Merge the two functions and make them callable with and without a \myAlgofont{keyStr}.

\paragraph{Drawbacks:}
The \mychanID of \texttt{createViewCryptor2} is 16 bytes long, while the one of \texttt{createFileCryptor2} has 24 bytes.
Furthermore, \texttt{createFileCryptor2} does not use the secondary signing key pair that is produced by \texttt{createViewCryptor2}.
