\subsection{Name of Team Roles}

\paragraph{Problem:}
The four roles in a team are called \textit{viewer}, \textit{member}, \textit{admin}, and \textit{owner}.
The role \textit{member} conflicts with the common notion of \enquote{being a member of a team}.

\paragraph{Consequences:}
Users are confused about the difference and precise wording in documentations is difficult.

\paragraph{Suggestions:}
Replace \textit{member} with \textit{author}.

\paragraph{Drawbacks:}
The notion of an \textit{author} may not smoothly match the context of creating folders or drawing in a whiteboard.
