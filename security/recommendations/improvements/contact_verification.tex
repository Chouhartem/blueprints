\subsection{Contact Verification}

\paragraph{Problem:}
There is no easy way to verify whether a CryptPad contact corresponds to the expected person.
Profile pages contain the public key of the users, but they are not signed and hence spoofable.

\paragraph{Consequences:}
Attackers can impersonate a person and gain access to teams, documents and folders.

One approach could be to use safety numbers~\cite{Marlinspike2016} to let users verify whether the binding of the public key to the user is correct.
It is important to provide a clean interface that is easily understandable for users and invites them to actually perform the contact verification.
