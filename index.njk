title: CryptPad Blueprints
---

<article class="block">
  CryptPad is an end-to-end encrypted collaboration suite that has been under
  active development since 2015, and is used by hundreds of thousands of people.
  Its feature set has grown from a simple editor to a full-blown set of multiple
  applications, drive, teams, etc.

  We plan to make the next generation of CryptPad even better with stronger
  security guarantees, offline-first collaborative editing, and user-driven
  workflows like password reset. This project is the first step in this direction.

  These future developments will involve significant work to implement. They also
  have to be considered in relation to the existing architecture, guarantee access
  to all existing data, and preserve a coherent experience for users. Therefore a
  migration path has to be carefully outlined to go from the current state of the
  product to a proposed "next generation".

  With CryptPad Blueprints we propose to thoroughly review the current state of
  CryptPad, and to plot the trajectory towards its next generation. This is
  done through a series of deliverables outlined below, ranging from a white paper
  to technical prototypes.
